                    <h2>Why Front-End?</h2>
                    <p>
                      Growing up, I've always been fascinating with building websites.
                      Of course, back then, middle-school me equated moving some shapes
                      around on wix.com to be <q>web-development</q>. While I enjoyed
                      spending hours on end fiddling with wix.com, I couldn't help but
                      feel like a bit of a <q>web-developing</q> imposter because I
                      wasn't actually building my sites from scratch. Resigning myself
                      to the idea of always being an <q>imposter</q>, it wasn't until
                      my freshman year of college when I took my first programming
                      language that my desire to work in font-end development was
                      suddenly an attainable goal.

                <h2> TECHNICAL DECISIONS </h2>

                <h3> ORGANIZATIONAL SCHEME </h3>
                <p>
                    My site consists of 5 HTML pages (index.html, house_llark.html, house_llamister.html, house_llargaryen.html, and about.html),
                    1 external CSS stylesheet (style.css) and 4 JavaScript files (toggle_menu.js, house_info.js, sigil_click.js, and load.js).
                </p>


                <h3> MODULARITY: </h3>
                <p>
                    Before vigorously coding away, it was important that I first sketched out my designs on paper so that I could identify any elements,
                    functions, or sections of code that could be reused throughout my site.  Making sites as modular as possible not only eliminates code
                    redundancy, saves time, and facilitates debugging, but makes code a lot easier to work with when designing for responsiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I relied heavily on JQUERY’s .load() function to load universal HTML elements and JavaScript functions onto my site’s pages. For
                    example, I loaded the home page’s navigation menu and its corresponding JavaScript toggling functions on to each page of my site.
                    Because the “llama house” pages are identical in content and design, house_llamister.html and house_targaryen.html load content
                    entirely from house_llark.html.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with JQUERY’s .load(), I made my three “llama house” HTML pages more modular by packaging content and styling rules specific to
                    each house in JavaScript objects.  I then passed these JavaScript objects as parameters into a generic load function to populate each
                    of the “llama house” pages with unique content and color schemes.  For more information, see <q>js/house_info.js</q>.
                </p>

                <h3> RESPONSIVENESS: </h3>
                <p>
                    I found that structuring my page layouts for small-screen mobile devices first before building my way up to larger screens streamlined
                    the responsive design process.  Because this was my first project working with responsiveness, I initially tried a top-down approach,
                    resizing and deleting elements as I moved down screen widths.  I learned (perhaps the hard way) that many layouts and features,
                    particularly animations, don’t scale down very well.  Ultimately, creating a small, simple default layout that I could progressively
                    enhance at different screen widths proved more intuitive and efficient.
                </p>
                <p> Another advantage to a mobile first design process is that mobile content loads faster.  Because the mobile layout is the default, the
                    page doesn’t have to load any of the larger screen sizes’ extraneous content, meaning a faster user experience.
                </p>
                <p> I chose not to design my site exclusively around “standard” breakpoints but use them as a contextual guide to inform my design.
                    Because we live in a time of constantly evolving technology, the “standard” is always changing.  iPhones are getting larger and iPads
                    are getting smaller.  And that’s just Apple.  For this reason, I relied heavily on Google Chrome’s Device Mode tool to define my own
                    media query breakpoints.  I reformatted my design at widths where I felt it lost its wow factor.
                </p>

                <h3> USABILITY: </h3>
                <p>
                    User experience is an essential design factor to take into consideration. As someone who enjoys designing interactive sites with hovering
                    capabilities, it was important for me to scale myself back and not add interactive features at the expense of mobile user experience.
                    While hovering effects are a great visual indicator of clickable content, on a mobile device, items with hover effects must be clicked
                    twice to perform an action (once to activate the hover effect and the second to fire an event).  For this reason, I made sure to disable
                    my site’s hovering effects on screen widths smaller than 1200px (roughly the size of a small laptop screen). I also used automatic and/or
                    looped animations to visually queue mobile users to clickable content (i.e. the bouncing sigil images on the home page).
